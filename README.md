MySQL Database Management Project

Welcome to my MySQL Database Management Project! This repository contains various SQL scripts and instructions for creating and managing a student database.
The project covers table creation, data insertion, trigger management, and indexing. Below, you'll find a detailed overview of the tasks I've completed and how you can replicate the work.

Project Overview
In this project, I worked on creating and managing a MySQL database for a student management system. The database includes tables for student information, various triggers to automate tasks, views to simplify data retrieval, and indexes to optimize performance.

1. Setting Up the Environment
Before you start working on the project, make sure you have MySQL installed and running. You can download it from the official MySQL website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Install MySQL Server on Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation

Log in to MySQL
mysql -u root -p

2. Creating the Database
To create a new database named practice, run the following SQL command:
CREATE DATABASE practice;

3. Creating Tables
I created a students table with the following structure:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    second_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    student_address VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    marks INT,
    student_status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);

Explanation
id: Primary Key, Auto Incremented.
first_name and second_name: Student's first and last names.
student_address: Student's address.
email: Unique identifier for the student.
marks: Academic performance of the student.
student_status: Current status (Passed/Failed).
4. Inserting Data
Data can be inserted into the students table using the following SQL command:

INSERT INTO students (first_name, second_name, student_address, email, marks, student_status) VALUES
('John', 'Doe', 'New York', 'john_doe@example.com', 85, 'Passed'),
('Jane', 'Smith', 'Los Angeles', 'jane_smith@example.com', 92, 'Passed'),
('Alice', 'Johnson', 'Chicago', 'alice_johnson@example.com', 78, 'Failed'),
('Daniel', 'Johnson', 'Chicago', 'daniel_johnson@example.com', 98, 'Passed'),
('Felix', 'Mutua', 'Nairobi', 'felix_mutua@example.com', 88, 'Passed');

5. Creating and Managing Triggers
Trigger Example
To automatically calculate the to_pay value based on marks, use the following trigger:

DELIMITER $$

-- Create a trigger that updates the 'to_pay' column after a student's marks are updated
CREATE TRIGGER update_to_pay_after_marks_change
AFTER UPDATE ON students
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Update 'to_pay' as marks * 200
    UPDATE students SET to_pay = (NEW.marks * 200) WHERE id = NEW.id;
END$$

DELIMITER ;

Trigger Creation Instructions
Save the trigger creation script to a file, e.g., create_trigger.sql.
Execute the script using the command:

mysql -u root -p practice < /path/to/create_trigger.sql

6. Creating Views
View Example
Create a view to display specific student information:
CREATE VIEW student_show AS
SELECT first_name, marks, email, id FROM students;
View Usage
You can query the view as follows:
SELECT * FROM student_show;

7. Creating Indexes
Index Example
To create an index for optimizing queries that filter by first_name and second_name:
CREATE INDEX last_first_name
ON students(first_name, second_name);

Index Usage
Indexes improve query performance. Here’s how to view existing indexes:
SHOW INDEXES FROM students;

8. Executing SQL Scripts
Running SQL Scripts
To execute an SQL script file:
mysql -u root -p practice < /path/to/sql_script.sql

Replace /path/to/sql_script.sql with the actual path to your SQL script file.

Example Command
mysql -u root -p practice < ~/mysql/create_index.sql

9. Examples and Explanations
Triggers
Triggers are automatic actions performed in response to specific events on a table. They can be BEFORE or AFTER events like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

Examples:

BEFORE INSERT: Perform validation before adding new data.
AFTER UPDATE: Automatically update related data in another table.
BEFORE DELETE: Prevent deletion based on conditions.
Views
Views are virtual tables created from SELECT queries. They simplify complex queries and present data in a specific format.

Examples:

Basic View:

CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Using Views:
SELECT * FROM view_name;

Indexes
Indexes are used to speed up data retrieval. They are beneficial for columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, joins, or sorting operations.

Examples:

Single Column Index:
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

Composite Index:
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
